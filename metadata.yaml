description: "Lady Audley's Secret is a sensation novel by Mary Elizabeth Braddon\
  \ published in 1862. It was Braddon's most successful and well-known novel. Critic\
  \ John Sutherland (1989) described the work as \"the most sensationally successful\
  \ of all the sensation novels\". The plot centres on \"accidental bigamy\" which\
  \ was in literary fashion in the early 1860s. The plot was summarised by literary\
  \ critic Elaine Showalter (1982): \"Braddon's bigamous heroine deserts her child,\
  \ pushes husband number one down a well, thinks about poisoning husband number two\
  \ and sets fire to a hotel in which her other male acquaintances are residing\"\
  . Elements of the novel mirror themes of the real-life Constance Kent case of June\
  \ 1860 which gripped the nation for years. A follow-up novel, Aurora Floyd, appeared\
  \ in 1863. Braddon set the story in Ingatestone Hall, Essex, inspired by a visit\
  \ there. There have been three silent film adaptations, one UK television version\
  \ in 2000, and three minor stage adaptations.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
